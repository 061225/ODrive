This repository contains configuration and analysis scripts that runs on a PC. The other related repositories are:
* [OdriveFirmware](https://github.com/madcowswe/OdriveFirmware): Firmware that runs on the board.
* [ODriveHardware](https://github.com/madcowswe/ODriveHardware): Circuit board design.

There is also ODriveFPGA, which contains the FPGA logic and software that runs on the FPGA based ODrive. This is not currently in development, but may be resumed at some later date.
